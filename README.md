Infimum Linux

Infimum Linux, while it can be considered Yet Another Minimal Linux and learning project for me, aims to provide the most efficient Linux possible for a configuration. Over the next few months, I hope to provide some scripts, utilities, patches and eventually container images for using it.

TODO
Build a minimal system that can run in docker/vagrant
Build a minimal docker host

Currently using buildroot as the basis for the root, and adding into that.
